## London Underground Status


A simple Android app to display the statuses of the London tube lines.

It also includes other lines such as Tram, Overground and Tfl Rail, so strictly speaking it's not just the underground trains.

AS TFL say on their [website](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/), you'll need to register to use their feeds.  Then, rename the `ApiConstantsExample.kt` file name to be `ApiConstants.kt`.  
Rename the variables: Remove the `_EXAMPLE` part of the name in the constants `APPLICATION_ID_EXAMPLE` and `APPLICATION_KEY_EXAMPLE`.  Replace the values with your own values which TFL will give you once you've registered.

Feel free to get in touch if you want to get involved, or submit a pull request.
